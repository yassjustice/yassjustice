**Software Craftsman · Tool Builder · Technical Cofounder**

Morocco 🇲🇦 &nbsp;·&nbsp; EN / FR / AR

I don't just write code — I build tools that solve real problems.\
If something frustrates me, I build the fix. If something doesn't exist yet, I make it.

### ⚡ What I Actually Do

- **Build tools & products** — not just features on someone else's app
- **Design systems that scale** — UI libraries, theme engines, component architectures
- **Ship fast, iterate faster** — 60+ repos and counting, learning by constructing
- **Bridge cultures through code** — trilingual apps with full RTL & i18n support

### 🔭 What I'm Building

| Project | What it is |
|---------|-----------|
| **VersatilesUI** | A handcrafted React UI library — multilingual (EN/FR/AR), RTL-native, full theme engine |
| **ColorViz** | Real-time color palette visualizer with WCAG accessibility analysis |
| **Design Principles Guide** | Interactive guide to premium modern design — built as an app, not a PDF |
| **FlashCard Chemistry** | Study tool that makes memorization less painful |

### 🛠 Stack

### 🧬 How I Work

I learn by building. Four CV builders taught me more than any course.\
I systematize — I don't make things pretty once, I build systems that make things pretty forever.\
I build for real people — a vendor management platform for fashion production, a dhikr app for daily practice, a culture quiz for heritage preservation.

### 🎯 Currently

- **CTO & Technical Cofounder** — building a cross-platform product from zero to launch
- **Exploring** — AI-powered workflows, agentic development, and tools that think with you
- **Interested in** — ambitious projects at the intersection of technology, education, and culture
